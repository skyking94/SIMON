# SIMON
SIMON Encryption / Decryption Core with variable block and key sizes


Status: Developing.


Description: 
- Verilog implementation of SIMON Encryption / Decryption Core with support for allowed set of input block sizes and key sizes which can be used as an IP Core for any FPGA/ASIC design. 
- It is also opened up as a project in [OpenCores](https://opencores.org/project/simon-core-with-variable-block-and-key-sizes). 
- Currently, it is in the ***development*** phase with most of the logic for datapath and key scheduling ready. The control path for various rounds as well as adding the feature to support decryption core within the same logic.
